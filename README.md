# 🍽️ Restaurant Data Exploratory Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a restaurant dataset to understand trends related to restaurant ratings, cuisines, locations, and customer preferences. The analysis aims to extract meaningful insights through data cleaning, statistical summaries, visualizations, and geographic mapping.

---

## 📊 Dataset Information
- Records: ~10,000 rows
- Type: Restaurant business data
- Features include:
  - Restaurant location (city, latitude, longitude)
  - Cuisines
  - Aggregate ratings
  - Votes
  - Cost-related attributes

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – data cleaning & manipulation
- **Matplotlib** – data visualization
- **Folium** – interactive geographic mapping
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## 🔍 Analysis Performed
- Initial data inspection using `info()` and `describe()`
- Handling large datasets efficiently using Pandas
- Statistical analysis of restaurant ratings and votes
- Grouping and aggregation to analyze:
  - Average ratings by city
  - Popular cuisines
  - Customer engagement trends
- Data visualization for better interpretation
- Interactive map visualization using latitude and longitude data

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Certain cities show consistently higher average restaurant ratings
- Popular cuisines vary significantly across locations
- Higher customer votes often correlate with better aggregate ratings
- Geographic distribution reveals restaurant density patterns

---

## 🗺️ Visualization Highlights
- Rating and vote distributions
- City-wise average ratings
- Cuisine-based comparisons
- Interactive restaurant map using **Folium**
